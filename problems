#problem 1

#Write a function named right_justify that takes a string named s as a parameter and prints the
#string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the
#Display.

def right_justify(s):
    print "%70s" % s



#problem 3

# Two words are anagrams if you can rearrange the letters from one to spell
# the other. Write a function called is_anagram that takes two strings and
# returns True if they are anagrams.

stringOne = "boom"
stringTwo = "doom"


def is_anagram(stringOne, stringTwo):
    print sorted(stringOne) == sorted(stringTwo)

is_anagram(stringOne, stringTwo)
